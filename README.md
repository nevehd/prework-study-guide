# Pre-work Study Guide Webpage for Web-Developer Bootcamp

## Description

The motivation fort his project was to create a webpage which has notes on all of the topics covered in the bootcamp prework.

I built this project to keep key notes on the different topics covered in the prework and create a real-life scenario to put the skills learnt into practice.

It solves the problem of not having a centralised area to keep my notes.

As I am already familiar with HTML and CSS, I mainly learnt JavaScript.

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
